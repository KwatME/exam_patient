## Measure radial pulse

## Measure blood pressure

## Measure jagular venous pulsation

Have patient angle at 45 degrees and turn head to the left, measure distance from sternal angle to pulsation.

5cm + distance should be less than 10cm.

## Check carotid pulse

One side at a time, feel artery.

One side at a time, have patient take a deep breath and hold, and (bell) auscultate artery.

## Check heart

Feel apex (point of maximal impact), which is palpable only in 25% of adults.

(Diaphram) auscultate LLSB, LICS2, apex, and RICS2.

Bell is good at hearing low frequency sounds of S3, S4, and mitral stenosis.

(Bell) auscultate apex.

## Check peripheral pulse

Brachial artery

Popliteal artery

Distal tibial artery

Dorsalis pedis artery

## Check edema

Push distal tibia for 2 seconds and check for indention.
